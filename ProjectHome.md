# Visualizing Changes in Wiki Articles #
A Mediawiki Extension to visualize changes of an article.

For now, just highlighting the changes that were made from one revision to another.

Future Ideas:
  * Show changes that were made to one specific section of the article
  * Show how often the article was changed in general, and how often/how much it was changed in recent times
  * Show how often a certain part of the article was changed
  * Show discussions in some way?
  * Highlight major changes of an article?
